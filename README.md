# reduced_order_modeling
Code and reports from the University of South Carolina summer 2022 REU on the mathematical foundations of data science.

Produced in cooperation with Malcolm Gaynor, with guidance from advisor Zhu Wang and graduate assistant Yuwei Geng.

Code requires the ATHENA library (https://github.com/mathLab/ATHENA). The tutorials in this library were used as guides for our own code.
